LAB PROJECT -- Version: Lab 6
=============================
By: Team Trace (Jacob Dyer, Deepti Sachi, Ethan Whitton, Q Russell, and Kenny Lee)

Installation/Setup:
-------------------
1. Download the project.
2. Run command 'npm install'.

To Use the Project:
-------------------
1. Run command 'node server' to start the lab's backend.
2. Run command 'ng serve' to start the lab's frontend.
3. Connect to the site normally at 'http://localhost:3000/', it will
   redirect you to 'http://localhost:4200/'.


Work Log:

Jacob Dyer
----------
Visualization 1: Comparing API Endpoint Usage via Sequences Sunburst.
Visualization 2: Comparing API User Usage Metrics via Horizontal Bar Chart.

Worklog:
- Set up the Angular for the project.
- Devised a method to "plug and play" with routers and static directories.
    > SEE 'server.js' AND 'config.json' for more.

Creativity:
- As mentioned in item 2 of my worklog, I approached the problem of adding and removing
  routers and static directories from a different angle and made it the domain of the
  configuration file.  This has the added benefit of further allowing us to check if
  a static directory or router is the source of an error on application startup.

Deepti Sachi
------------
Visualization 1: Tracking tag usage by user and corresponding uploads by tag.
Visualization 2: Tracking viewer frequency over time.

Worklog:
- I created a separate router function in User.Router and Image.Router to return a randomized .csv file. The link at http://localhost:4200/lab6 will return a .csv file for an arbitrarily selected ID, but other IDs should work as well.
Part 1: Creating Your Datasets
- I used an arbitrarily-chosen user ID to pull information from the database. I used a random Javascript function to simulate viewer counts and tags, since these are not provided by the database.
Part 2: Creating Your Visualizations
- I chose to use R to display visualizations, since D3 was difficult to implement. A simple lollipop graph was suitable for the viewer count, but I had trouble organizing a proper CSV format and therefore visualization for the tag usage. I ultimately settled on a treemap (where tags were the groups, and corresponding image uploads were the subgroups), though there was some difficulty in getting R to display the text at a proper size.
Part 3: Displaying Your Visualizations
- The images and router methods can be used at http://localhost:4200/lab6
