  <p>
    Trace is a way for artists and other visual creators to manage exclusive access to their works and address the cases where somebody reuploads their work without permission.
  </p>

  <h3>Access management?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the common trends for visual artists is to sell exclusive early access to features such as in-progress works or special pictures to paying customers.
    Here at Trace, we provide the ability to create private image albums with a special emphasis on managing who does and who does not have access to your work.
    The reason why you should consider using Trace to host an image is because it better enables you to address the problem of image reuploading.
  </p>

  <h3>Addressing image reuploading?</h3>
  <p>
    What makes the exclusive access arrangement dangerous for visual creators are those who take their paid version of your works and redistribute them for free.
    Although the problem itself is fully impossible to prevent so long as an image can be viewed by somebody other than the artist alone,
    Trace exists to make finding the source of your leaked images easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    To this end, we employ steganography, the art of hiding information such as text or whole images in plain sight, to produce unique, hidden watermarks that are applied to the images that your customers view.
    When you discover an image has been leaked, you can upload the image back to us here at Trace, and automatically learn who among the private image circle downloaded the viewed image and ended up redistributing the image without your permission.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-center pt-4 pb-2">Steganography (n.): "The art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file."</h2>
  <p class="pt-2">
    To accomplish our promise to artists and other visual creators,
    Trace employs steganography to subtly mark up images intended for a closed audience.
    In the case that the image is ever released elsewhere without the creator's authorization and discovered,
    the leaked image can be uploaded back into Trace to identify who released the image without permission.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Method:</h3>
  <p>
    When you decide to share a private image with somebody else through Trace, we add a "fingerprint" to the image before it is sent to the recipient's computer.
    Our reason to use steganography as opposed to watermark generation is that the visible effects of stegaonography are almost imperceptible to the eye.
    When our software modifies your image before serving it, many individual pixels of the image are slightly changed in order to have the fingerprint "blend in" with the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once an image is reuploaded for evaluation, Trace can interpret the fingerprint and determine who downloaded the image.
    What you do with the information is up to you alone, but we do offer you the ability to restrict the offender's access to your images in the future.
